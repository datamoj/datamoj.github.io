# Balancing the Scale: Diversity in High-School English Curriculums
By Daniel Dykiel

## The West as the Center of the Universe

*Nigeria used to be a British colony.* The justification for why, in my junior-year English class, we were reading a single work by an African author. My English teacher’s peppy smile shone brightly under the fluorescent lights, and she looked around the room, to see if we were as excited as she was.

 My teacher had, indeed, accomplished something notable. She and the other English teachers had worked within the constraints of the English curriculum—*thou shalt teach British literature in eleventh grade*—and found a way to give students a break from works written by Western, white, mostly male authors.

But the reasoning was skewed. Why was it that we could only read *Purple Hibiscus*, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie—which focused on Nigerian culture—only because of the country’s connection to British colonial rule? Why wasn’t there space for it elsewhere in the curriculum? Sophomore year was American literature, while Freshman and Senior year were unthemed. But even then, we read overwhelmingly American or British works.

This reminded me how “World History” was thinly-veiled “European History,” with three weeks of African history shoved in the middle, to say nothing of Asia or Latin America. If our school did move away from a Western focus, it shoved whole swathes of the world into tiny boxes, bursting at the seams.

During the long summer between high school and college, I sat in my town’s central coffeeshop. I liked it for its urban feel, the chrome chairs and stark lights, so aesthetically unlike my suburban town. I lived in an affluent neighbourhood, with a median household income of almost $150,000 (1). While there was a large population of Chinese and Indian immigrants in my school—my hometown had the 9th largest Chinese population in Massachusetts(1)—there were very few Latino or African-American students. 

I thought of a conversation I had with one of the school librarians, Ms. MacDonald. She talked about the importance of *The Bluest Eye* by Toni Morrison in building empathy—about how students who had never really thought about issues of classism and racism against African-Americans could be faced with them. The realization could be deeply moving, if not earth-shattering.

In the coffee shop, I had a spreadsheet on one half of my screen, and my Goodreads account on the other. I was making a spreadsheet on all the works I had personally been assigned to read in high school—which I kept track of on Goodreads—with information like publication year and author nationality. I knew that I wanted to quantify the data somehow. In a college digital journalism class, I got the chance to take a closer look.

## Data

The first thing I looked at was author nationality. Unsurprisingly, the works were mostly American or British. While we did read some works by immigrants and/or racial minorities in America or Britain, we only read three works by authors who weren’t linked to America or Britain at all.

Most shocking to me was the lack of Asian representation. We only read one work by a Chinese-American author—The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan—which examines the experiences of Chinese immigrants in America. And yet, the continent of Asia holds almost 60% of the world’s population (2). 

For my school specifically, which had such a high population of Asian-American students, a single book was especially lacking. The Indian-American students, meanwhile, didn’t have any works at all from an author of their background.

I also wanted to look at publication years for the works we read. We read a spattering of works pre-1910. Post 1910, we read similar amounts of works published for each decade. The notable exceptions are the 1950s (6 works read), the 1980s (3 works read), and the 2000s (3 works read).

This was relevant to another area I wanted to considert: how the diversity of works we were assigned to read changed based on the publication year.

This graph revealed some interesting trends in the data. As the publication dates become more recent, we read slightly more works by female authors.

For works published before the 1950s, we didn’t read a single work by a non-white American or British author. The first work we read by a non-white Western author was *A Raisin the Sun*, by Lorraine Hansberry, published in 1959. 

## Analysing Diversity Over Time

It seems like one way to diversify the English curriculum could be to teach more contemporary works, as contemporary works assigned tend to be more diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity.

Contemporary works often also have the benefit of being more engaging for students. Students in my classes were mainly bored by the ancient epics—I was the only student in my 20+ student class to write my midterm essay on Beowulf. The works I heard students have the most passionate discussions about tended to be more contemporary, such as *The Bluest Eye* by Toni Morrison (1970) or *Into the Wild* by John Kraukaur (1996).

By far the most popular assigned work in my high school was *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi (2016). It was assigned to be read by only some classes, instead of *Purple Hibiscus*, so I didn’t include it in my data. My friends in other classes talked about it so much—and recommended it so strongly—that I ended up reading it despite it not being assigned.

The details of defining the literary cannon and which books have merit to read is outside the scope of this article. However, I do want to argue that, regardless of what ratio we choose of older to newer works, curriculums are currently way over-valuing older works. Was it really necessary to read six works published in the 1950s, but not any works from our own decade? Is the current literary fiction movement—with many new authors of diverse backgrounds telling their stories—really not worth examining? I don’t think we should entirely discard older works—only de-emphasize them. 

As the contemporary works assigned tended to be more diverse, teaching more contemporary works may increase diversity diversity. That being said, there are still many older works by non-Western and/or non-white authors that are worth teaching, such as *Things Fall Apart* by Chinua Achebe and *100 Years of Solitude* by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

## Conclusion

The debate around which books exactly are worth being taught is a contentious one. My goal with this piece isn’t to provide all the answers. Rather, my goal is to examine my own personal experiences and highlight some deep-rooted issues. 

The bottom line is this: the books I was assigned to read as part of my high-school English curriculum are woefully unbalanced. They emphasize one set of voices over the entire rest of the world. They deprive students from differing perspectives, from rich literary movements, from gaining a better understanding of complex social issues, from building empathy. And that’s unacceptable.

My situation isn’t unique. Many American high schools teach books that are similarly Western and male centric, and this has deep implications.

Some people don’t read much outside of books assigned in high school. Some people do read outside of high school, but don’t think of reading outside their respective bubbles. It’s only by re-balancing the books we read—whether that be administrators overhauling their curriculums, English teachers working around strict curriculums to teach the books they think are important, or a personal effort to read more broadly—that we can stop ourselves from being cut off from the rest of the world. 

## Additional Observations

The 1950s were overwhelmingly the decade with the most works read, but especially not diverse. We read five works by white, Western male authors, and one work by an African-American woman.

Interestingly, the 1980s were more diverse. We read three works, none of them by white, Western male authors.

While outside the scope of this piece, looking at the historical context for these decades may be an interesting point for further analysis.

## Methods

The data in these graphs represents only the works that I was assigned to read in high school. I looked at novels and plays I read, not counting short stories or poems. 

Within my highschool, the works read changed based on who the teacher of the course was, and what level the course was: “Honors,” “Accelerated/Enriched,” or “College Prep.” 

While I included The Odyssey and Beowulf in my graph of author nationalities, much of the specifics aren’t known about when these works are written—such as date written and who the author(s) were. As such, I didn’t include them in graphs about gender and time.  

I made graphs using flourish.studio. The links to my graphs, and the data used, are as follows:
