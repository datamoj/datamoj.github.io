# Take SAT Like There Are No Timezones

SAT is one of the widely used standardized exams for college admissions in the United States and some other countries. Every year, more than 2 million American high school graduates sit down for 3 hours to have a good score to reach their dream college. However, the United States is not the only country that you can take the test. There are over 175 countries that high school graduates can go and take the test to try their chance in American colleges. The test is offered 7 times every year in the United States and 4 times internationally. It is a huge operation across the world and not easy to manage. I will tell you my story and how I saw the questions, that I solved laboriously inside the test center, on Reddit just after I finished the test.

I wasn't sure about writing this piece because I didn't think a scandal that is so important can be this easy to see. After I did my research and spending hours on Reddit to find the old topics that I saw the questions (most of them are deleted by Reddit moderators, obviously). After finding some evidence and seeing that [other people talk about this as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/blznjk/how_does_the_college_board_prevent_cheating/), I decided to tell my story.

### The Problem

Although the SAT is mostly for American high school graduates, it is an international exam. In 2014, more than 300,000 people took SAT outside the United States. Other than [many](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/how-sophisticated-test-scams-from-china-are-making-their-way-into-the-us/474474/) [other](https://www.applerouth.com/blog/2018/08/30/unpacking-the-august-sat-cheating-scandal/) [scandals](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/03/11/college-board-calls-sat-three-countries) (+bonus: [this user](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/8gr2zy/april_reading_passages_link_in_the_description/) predicted 2 essays correctly 2 days before the exam.), there is one huge thing about SAT: everyone takes it at 8 a.m. in their time zones. This is not a problem in the United States because the time difference between the east coast and west coast is just enough for the test. Also, there is one American and one international version of SAT so American high schoolers can't get the questions from their European friends. However, a Turkish student can get questions from an Indian student or a Spanish student can get questions from a Turkish student. 

Does this actually happen? Do people share questions? That should be the question.

It's been almost 2 years and I can't remember the questions. I remember only one of the questions that I saw on Reddit because that was my only mistake in Math section. There were so many questions on Reddit and I was really confident about the score I will get because I literally saw all of them after the exam. Some of them were posted while I was taking the test and some of them were posted before I took it.

Even though I can't remember the questions now, it is easy to find a [discussion topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/8h4th4/official_may_2018_international_sat_discussion/) on Reddit and check the dates. I am not going to share any specific questions here because it is neither ethical nor legal. As an example, here is two screenshots of people asking about questions:

I took the test on Saturday May 5th at 8 am. This post was sent about an hour before I went to the test center. And yes, down below this screenshot someone talks about one of the math problems. This message is from a huge "[SAT International Version Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/8h4th4/official_may_2018_international_sat_discussion/)" topic that was created 1.5 hours before I started the exam, and there are both deleted and not deleted messages that are also posted before I went to the test center. If I knew, I could easily look at some of the problems and at least start thinking about them before the exam.

### Is it possible to solve this?

Yes and no. TOEFL is another test that is administrated by ETS. It is a standardized test to measure the English language ability of non-native speakers wishing to enroll in English-speaking universities. The electronic version of the TOEFL test always gives random questions every time you take the test. Even though you can study the specific types of questions and prepare templates, it is not easy to guess the questions that are taken from a huge question pool. Even though this could solve the problem it causes other problems about the difference in test difficulties for each student. It seems like people accept this with TOEFL so I don't see any reason for not doing the same.

### My email to the College Board

To ask about all of these, I sent an email to the College Board support desk and haven't received a response yet (It's been 27 days). I will update this section after I get an answer.
