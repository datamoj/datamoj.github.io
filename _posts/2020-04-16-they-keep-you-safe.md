           <p>I wake up with moving skin. In the night, it’s become a living being. My lover’s warmth seeps my arm, and I feel it from outside of myself. They ask me about my dreams and I don’t tell them. </p>
	<p>Weeks later, I stand in front of a Dali painting and almost have a panic attack. The mania rises, compounds. I still it with my breaths, but the levels keep getting higher. I can’t pull myself away. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="3">
	  <p>A friend once told me the way LSD changes your brain chemistry. He gets caught in simple, repetitive motions, still moments. Particles of the drug are released into his system, irrevocable embedded into him. He falls into the clinking of a spoon against a cup, the swirling of the cream and coffee. A moment turned more lucid, more evocative than reality. </p>
	<p>I hadn’t really believed him, at the time. But the painting moves. It pulls me in. The mythical texture of the paint—no photograph could ever do it justice. I lose myself in it and lose my partner in the gallery. Like so many times before, we miss each other. <i>I thought you needed space; I wanted you there. I thought it didn’t matter; it was a small moment that cut deep.</i></p> 
           </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="4">
           <p>This is a softer opening. Warm skin and open lips, gold tinted hair and sleepy mornings in slanted sunlight. Two people who love each other, two people who hurt each other, two people who learn and grow together.</p> 
	<p>Aches and pains buried, blackened earth crumbling.  A moment of stillness before confession. Terrified breath. Streaked hands when we dig them out again. We bury them again, lay them to rest. Cultivate a tenuous reconciliation. We grow, reach each other again.</p>
	<p>Work that is difficult, heart-wrenching, rewarding: but we don’t let it kill.</p>

	   <p>Let’s look at another opening. What my life used to be like before I learned to live it better.</p>

	  <div class="step" data-step="7">
	  <p>So. My brother. The humanitarian, empathetic soul, who didn’t have a violent bone in his body. My brother, who has made my cry more than any other person on earth.</p> 
<p>In an image more vivid than memory, more crystalline, with thicker and more vibrant strokes:</p>
<p>His expression visibly darkens. He says, “I already try hard enough not to hit mom.” His voice sends a cold shock through me. He keeps talking in a similar vein. It fills me with a muddy feeling of fear.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="step" data-step="8">

	<p><i>“Robbers and Angry Brothers,” dream journal entry, 06/30/2015</i></p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="9">
	 <p>And in a memory more semantic—nowhere in my journals, but wrapped in my fiction, in my vision—my brother grabs and shakes my shoulders. His face shadowed, inscrutable. His hands close around my throat. He lifts me toward the sky and my feet kick desperately for solid ground.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="10">
	 <p>At that time, the dream of my brother felt entirely unexpected. I didn’t know I was being gaslit. I didn’t know I was slowly being traumatized. All I knew is that I had a nightmare and an archetype. A vision overlaid, not of who he was, but of who he could be. Who he was sometimes. Who he was to me.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="11">
	 <p><a href="https://imgur.com/0gxvcUw"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0gxvcUw.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
	<p><i>Photograph, me and my brother, circa  2006<i/></p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="12">
	 <p>It’s time to talk about the dog. And this is where the danger starts. The spectre I still dance around. Snapping, barking. Too easy to turn sentimental,molded by circumstance. Too easy to fall into his voice. I’m not afraid of him anymore, but he gives me sharp edges I can’t smooth over.</p>
<p> His jaws, closing lengthwise along my mouth and nose. He leaves an ice-white scar on my upper lip. I’m twelve, or maybe ten.</p> 
<p>His jaws, closing around my leg. Older now, fifteen. This time, three little scars in a rough semicircle.</p>
<p>I run away from home for three days. When I come back, my mother doesn’t speak. <i>What kind of monster would treat an animal like this?</i> she seems to ask. I don’t have the heart to ask them to put him down; only to keep him behind a gate. <i>What kind of monster would blame him?</i></p> 
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="13">
	 <p>The dog saves my brother’s life but ruins mine. When he barks at me and shows his gleaming teeth, they blame me. When he fixates on my heels, following closely, lunging and snapping, they blame me.</p>
<p>This is why, for a period of my life, every conversation with my brother made me cry. This is why entering the blue house with the white shutters made my breath catch in my throat, my muscles tense—the beginning of a fight or flight response. This is why, even now, I feel that a simmering undercurrent of that house wants me dead.</p>

	<div class="step" data-step="15">
	 <p>It helps to see events from outside yourself—for your friends to say, <i>that happened? That’s really fucked-up.</i> But there’s still a part of yourself that says, <i>yes, that would be true—if it happened to anyone else. But not when it happens to me.</i></p>
<p>Nuance is both essential and dangerous. I believe that no people are truly bad, that we’re all doing the best we can to live on this spinning sphere of rock we call home. But to fully accept someone’s humanity, you first have to face the pain they caused you head-on.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="16">
	 <p>For a long time, I was too close. My house, with its toxic fog catching in my chest, seemed normal. I had spent so long thinking of my brother as a good person that I couldn’t reconcile the suffering he caused me. The only answer, then, was that I was the problem.</p>
<p>Even while I was complacent, my subconscious struggled for air. Even while I could only use the same set of words to describe him, my nightmare cast light on a side of him I only ever saw in shadow. <i>Look at this,</i> they said, when I found myself crying in the kitchen, in my bedroom, on the neighbourhood walks we sometimes took together. <i>Look at his hands wrapped around your throat.</i></p>
	</div>
	<div class="step" data-step="17">
	 <p>I was having nightmares, I knew, because a capital-C conversation loomed. Normally, I was borderline obsessive about addressing issues before they grew. I would pass over lines of communication—a pencil pressed down into paper again and again until it tears.</p>
<p>But this—I didn’t have words for it. It was too nebulous, too fundamental. And there seemed to be danger in giving this spectre life: in giving it breath and form.</p>

	<div class="step" data-step="19">
	 <p>His memoir is about white supremacy—but the story he describes is imbued, not so separate in ourselves. Fallacies of ego leading to lack of empathy; disconnect in close relationships; people who aren’t fundamentally bad doing bad things.</p> 
<p>Nothing is really separate. And into my new, adult relationships, I carried my terror of inescapable little hurts. Not for their concrete impact—but for what they represented. I had read too much literature about the universe as a tenuous organism, a thoughtless word or action enough to change a relationship fundamentally. Their implications can be gut-dropping.</p>
