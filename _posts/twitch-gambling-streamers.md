# Twitch Gambling Streamers

Twitch is the biggest live streaming platform today with an average of 55 thousand live channels and 1.5 million viewers at any time. Twitch has 35.6k streaming partners and the number is growing very fast. Even though the platform is known by game streaming, this is about to change. "Just Chatting" category is the second most popular category after League of Legends. Today, another trend in Twitch is gambling streams. Experienced Blackjack and Poker players have huge number of followers and subscribers, who pay a monthly fee mostly to support the streamer.

Most Twitch streamers with more than a couple hundred subscribers stream for a living. They get paid from 2 to 3 dollars per each subscriber (depending on their channel's size and their agreement with Twitch). Twitch also shares a portion of the ad revenue with partner streamers. In addition to that, they usually have sponsors that giveaway their products or sometimes just give money to advertise their brand.

Social media influencers have the power to affect the purchasing decisions of other because of his or her authority, knowledge, or position. For Twitch streamers, the most important factor is the relationship with their audience. People subscribe to channels they like both to support them but also to be able to have more chance to connect them. Because of the relationship that streamers build with their audience, people like and trust their streamers. 

Nowadays, most Twitch streamers also have Youtube channels where they both create new content and also share their clips from their streams. Gambling streamers do that as well. In fact, it is even more helpful to them than others because in Youtube have the chance to share only the clips that they win, instead of showing everything. We can't really blame them for this, because who wants to watch a man losing money for 30 minutes? However, it helps these people to build trust about their gambling techniques.

Some gambling Twitch streamers use this trust and authority to sell online courses to learn gambling techniques, recommended websites, and sometimes even ways to put and get their money from a website safely. Even though most people believe that these people make a living out of gambling, some people question how they can have this much money to play hours of Blackjack and Poker.

To check if they actually make profit, I wrote a python script that converts Twitch Blackjack stream recordings to beautiful line charts.
